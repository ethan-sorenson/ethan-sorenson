## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Welcome to my profile

Iâ€™m Ethan Sorenson â€” an integration specialist and Dynamics 365 Business Central Developer with a passion for building practical, scalable solutions.
By day, I work at eOne Solutions helping customers and partners maximize the value of our integration and automation tools.
By night (and coffee-fueled weekends â˜•), I explore new technologies, experiment with AL development, and contribute to projects that make business systems work smarter.


## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
* AL Language for Dynamics 365 Business Central â€“ extensions, event subscribers, and API integrations
* JavaScript â€“ UI customization, data transformations, and BC companion scripts
* Python â€“ automation, API consumption, and data processing


## ðŸ“Œ Featured Projects
### [1. Post Orders Web Service](https://github.com/ethan-sorenson/PostOrdersWebService)
An AL extension that creates a web service for bulk posting transactions by leveraging standard posting Codeunit logic.

* Creates a new API endpoint for posting Orders
* Accepts custom-defined filter criteria from external services
* Returns detailed error messages in the API response

### [2. Item Image Web Service](https://github.com/ethan-sorenson/ItemImageWebService)
A proof-of-concept AL project for working with Item Images externally via a web service.
* GET endpoint: Reads the primary item image for a list of products as Base64 encoded images
* PATCH endpoint: Accepts a Base64 encoded image and links it to the item
* PATCH endpoint: Accepts a public image URL and links it to the item

### [3. SmartConnect ConnectWise Templates](https://github.com/ethan-sorenson/SmartConnectConnectWise)
My most ambitous project yet, providing a complete integration toolkit between Business Central and ConnectWise using SmartConnect.
* Business Central Extension - Custom fields and API pages to facilitate the integrations
* SmartConnect Maps - Integration mapping files linking the ConnectWise API to Business Central
* Documentation - Comprehensive Wiki and in-repo README files to guide setup and usage
